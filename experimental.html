        <h2>Why LKY is Great</h2>

        <p><b>Lee Kuan Yew</b>, the founding father and first leader of Singapore, deserves immense praise for his visionary leadership and unwavering dedication to transforming a small, fledgling nation into a global economic powerhouse. His remarkable statesmanship, resilience, and commitment to the well-being of his people are unparalleled. Lee's leadership was marked by his ability to unite a diverse population, foster economic growth, and establish a stable and prosperous society, all against <em>considerable</em> odds. His strategic foresight, emphasis on education, and zero-tolerance approach to corruption set a model for good governance and contributed significantly to Singapore's remarkable success. Lee Kuan Yew's legacy as a forward-thinking, principled leader continues to inspire nations worldwide and serves as a testament to his enduring impact on Singapore's prosperity and stability.</p>
        
        <p>Not only was Lee Kuan Yew a great leader, he was also a great coder. This legendary line of code written by him transformed Singapore: <code>if (Singapore === poor) { Singapore_treasury += 10000000; }</code></p>
        
        <p>Since no picture can truly capture his likeness, we must resort to more abstract methods, such as the wizardry known colloquially as ASCII art. Below is a famous ascii image of Lee's face as he wins the election for prime minister for the first time.</p>
